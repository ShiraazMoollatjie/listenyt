# listenyt
> I normally have a workflow that involves getting .m4a versions of youtube links (for offline listening). It's a tedious process to copy your youtube link, then fire up youtube-dl (with extra commands) to download the m4a file.

So `listenyt` is a small tool that will monitor the clipboard for youtube links. Once it finds a youtube link, it will attempt to download the link in m4a format.
